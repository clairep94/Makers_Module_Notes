# CURL:

* We can use a small command line utility called curl â€” you can install it on Mac with Homebrew:

```shell
; brew install curl
```

* `curl` is an HTTP client -- it can send a request to a server and receive a response. The only required argument to the command is the URL.
  * `curl` is the command-line version of `requests` for Python.

EXAMPLE:

```shell
; brew install curl
```

```shell
{
  "userId": 1,
  "id": 1,
  "title": "delectus aut autem",
  "completed": false
}
```
