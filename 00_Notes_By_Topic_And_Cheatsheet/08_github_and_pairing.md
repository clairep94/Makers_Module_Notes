# GITHUB & PAIRING

## PAIRING:

### Day 1 Example:

* Alice & Bob are collaborating
* Alice makes a repo on her GH (REPO-A), Bob is added as a collaborator
* Bob _**CLONES**_ Alice's repo, NOT FORK (REPO-A)
* Either person can push/pull to main (REPO-A)


### Day 2 Example:

* Alice & Zoe are pairing
* Alice is farther behind -- Zoe clones Alice's repo and they work on that together
* Zoe still has her repo from day 1 (REPO-X)

* Bob & Casear are paring
* Bob is farther behing -- Bob forks Alice's repo (REPO-A clone = REPO-A2) **!Fork repos that are not on your GH once you are not pairing with them!** -- fork or change to new remote URL

* Caesar clones Bob's repo (REPO-A2)
* Caesar still has his repo from day 1 (REPO-Y)

**At the end of every day:**
