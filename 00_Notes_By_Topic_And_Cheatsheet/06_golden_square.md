# THE GOLDEN SQUARE:

Refers to four software engineering practices:

1. Test-Driving (TDD)
2. Object-Oriented (OOD or OOP)
3. Debugging
4. Pairing

## TEST-DRIVING:

Test-driving is a method for creating software that involves:

1. Deciding what you want the software to do.
2. Writing tests to check that it does that.
3. Writing the code to pass those tests.

It is called test-driven development because you write the tests first, then focus on making them pass.


## OBJECT-ORIENTED DESIGN:

A way of structuring code using objects and classes.

Classes - blueprints for objects

* classes look after some data (state) with a common group of methods (behaviour).


Objects - encapsulate ('wrap') values ('state' or 'memory'), providing methods that control access to those values and do useful work.

## DEBUGGING:

Debugging is the name for a collection of different approaches for dealing with the situation when the code does something you don't intend it to for reasons you don't understand.


## PAIRING:

Pair programming, or pairing, is two programmers working on the same thing at the same time.

### DRIVER-NAVIGATOR:

* The Navigator provides instructions to the Driver. They are responsible for managing of the process of programming, the goal, the plan, what is in or out of scope at this moment. They generally shouldn't be typing or looking anything up.

* The Driver takes instruction and writes code. They are responsible for asking any questions they need to understand what they need to do, looking anything up that the pair needs to know. They should propose things to do where they have an idea, but the navigator makes the decision. They generally shouldn't take action without the navigator's instruction.

* They are both responsible for delivering quality work, for understanding what they are doing, communicating their thoughts, sharing their knowledge, generating potential solutions, and being considerate of each other.


#### Suggested cycle:

0. Get to know how each person works & find the location to work

1. Pick someone to drive or navigate at the start.
2. The navigator will set a timer for 25 minutes. (45min if comfortable)
3. Pair-program until the timer goes off.
4. Take a 5 minute break.
5. Swap driver-navigator roles and return to step 2.

6. Reflect:

* On a scale of 1-10, how much did you understand what we did today?

* On a scale of 1-10, how engaged did you feel in our work today?
